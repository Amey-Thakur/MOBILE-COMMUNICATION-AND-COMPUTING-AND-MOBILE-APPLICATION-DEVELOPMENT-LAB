                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Mobile Communication and Computing (CSC702) and Mobile Application Development Lab (CSL702) are core subjects in the Final Year (Semester VII) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide comprehensive knowledge of wireless communication systems, mobile networks, and hands-on Android application development.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Mobile Communication and Computing:

- **Wireless Communication Fundamentals**: Radio propagation, modulation techniques, spread spectrum, CDMA.
- **Mobile Computing Architecture**: Mobile device architecture, operating systems, application frameworks.
- **Cellular Networks**: GSM architecture, call management, handoffs, location management.
- **Mobile IP and Protocols**: Mobile IP operation, routing, transport layer protocols (TCP, UDP).
- **Android Application Development**: Activities, intents, fragments, services, broadcast receivers, content providers.
- **Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET)**: Routing protocols, QoS, security in mobile networks.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding mobile communication protocols and mobile app development is crucial for building modern connected systems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of mobile computing concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through MCC and MAD Lab.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
